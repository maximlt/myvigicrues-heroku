# [LEARNING] My little Vigicrues

A basic [`panel`](https://panel.holoviz.org/) dashboard that displays discharge data retrieved from the French [API HUBEAU](https://hubeau.eaufrance.fr/). Its name stems from the French flood warning system [Vigicrues](https://www.vigicrues.gouv.fr/).

This repo served as an example to learn how to deploy a `panel` app on **Heroku** (some info [here](https://panel.pyviz.org/user_guide/Server_Deployment.html)).
